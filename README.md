This is some sort of 3d game i made following ThinMatrix's LWJGL java game [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP), the experience of following this tutorial was very useful, because it gave me a new perspective on 3d graphics generation and also make me understand why i learned matrix and all that mathematical stuff at school.

The assets used are not mine.
